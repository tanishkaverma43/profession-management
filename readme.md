# Employee Manager Application

## Project Overview
The Employee Manager Application is a web-based tool that allows users to efficiently manage a list of employees. Users can add new employees by entering their name, profession, and age into the input form. The application then displays the added employees in a list, with an option to delete any employee from the list.

## Features
- **Add Employees:** Users can input employee details (Name, Profession, Age) and add them to the list.
- **Delete Employees:** Employees displayed in the list can be removed by clicking the "Delete" button.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Displays success messages when employees are added successfully.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Clean and simple UI with dark theme and green accents for buttons.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** (Optional) Can be extended using PHP, Node.js, etc.
- **Database:** (Optional) Can integrate with MySQL or Firebase for persistent storage.
